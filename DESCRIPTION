Title: Covariate Specific Treatment Effect (CSTE) Curve
Description: A uniform  statistical inferential tool in making 
    individualized treatment decisions, which implements the methods of  
    Ma et al. (2017)<DOI:10.1177/0962280214541724>
    and Guo et al. (2021)<DOI:10.1080/01621459.2020.1865167>. 
    It uses a flexible semiparametric modeling strategy for heterogeneous treatment effect
    estimation in high-dimensional settings and can gave valid confidence bands. Based on it,  
    one can find the subgroups of patients that benefit from each treatment, thereby  making 
    individualized treatment selection.
